# Overview

- A windows form app to manage a pediatric clinic.
- We used Agile (Scrum) as our development process method to tackle various issues and tasks to finish the basic features of the app in the first sprint.
- The sprint length was 3 weeks and we used Jira as a software tool to track our progress.
